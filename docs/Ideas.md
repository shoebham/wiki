# Ideas 
This is where I will share my ideas, things i want to build or find interesting list of sites where I can find relevant information 


previously i used to store ideas in a whatsapp chat, but i realised this is a better way.
 - #idea:  time estimator that shows reading time on a webpage and videos
 - #idea: sending messages to whatsapp chat with #tag automatically adds ideas to a template
	 - Kind of like obsidian and whatsapp sync bot
 - #idea: LLM that runs locally that can be fed conversations from apps, then we can ask it question
 - #idea A Resume AI chatbot where you can LLM is trained on resume and anybody can ask questions based on the resume. ex. [jon-olson.com](https://www.jon-olson.com/resume_ai)
 - #idea extension to add explain <-copied-text-> to ChatGPT to Right click menu
